## My Goal

The objective of this project  is to practice the core programming concepts that will form the foundation of most of the apps I will build in the future. This app will teach how to make apps with functionality using setState() inside Stateful Flutter widgets.


## What I will create

I will make a Las Vegas dice app. You can make the die roll at the press of a button. With this app in your pocket, youâ€™ll be able to settle any score on the go!

## What I had learn

- How to use Flutter stateless widgets to design the user interface.
- How to use Flutter stateful widgets to update the user interface.
- How to change the properties of various widgets.
- How to use onPressed listeners to detect when buttons are pressed.
- How to use setState to mark the widget tree as dirty and requiring update on the next render.
- How to use Expanded to make widgets adapt to screen dimensions.
- Understand and use string interpolation.
- Learn about basic dart programming concepts such as data types and functions.
- Code and use gesture controls.
